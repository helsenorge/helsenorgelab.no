# Setting up a local build

This repository includes a Vagrantfile for running the project in a Debian VM and a fabfile for running common commands with Fabric. 
Make sure [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) are installed

To set up a new build:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/helsenorgelab/helsenorgelab.no.git
cd helsenorgelab.no
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

Then within the SSH session:

``` bash
dj migrate
dj createcachetable
dj createsuperuser
djrun
```

This will make the site available on the host machine at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

# Front-end assets

To build front-end assets you will additionally need to run the following commands in the `website/static_src` folder:

 ```bash
npm install
npm run build:prod
```

After any change to the CSS or Javascript you will need to run the build command again, either in the vm or on your host machine. See the [Front-end tooling docs](website/static_src/README.md) for further details.


## Deployment
The static assets should be automatically generated on deployment and you do
not need to commit them. The command used to generate the production version
of static files is `npm run build:prod`.

# Servers
VM should come preinstalled with Fabric, Heroku CLI and AWS CLI.

## Login to Heroku
Please log in to Heroku before executing any commands for servers hosted there
using the `heroku login -i` command. You have to do it both in the VM and your
host machine if you want to be able to use it in both places.

## Authenticate with Dokku
You need to have your SSH key added by a sysadmin to the Dokku server in order
to be able to connect to it.

## Pulling data

To populate your local database with the content from production:

``` bash
fab pull-production-data
```

Additionally, to fetch images and other media.

``` bash
fab pull-production-media
```

(This will only take the "original" images. New versions of the other renditions will be recreated on the fly.)

## Deployments

To deploy the site to dev/staging/production:


``` bash
fab deploy-staging
fab deploy-production
```

## Connect to the shell

To open the shell of the servers.

```bash
fab staging-shell
fab production-shell
```

## Pushing database and media files

Please be aware executing those commands is a possibly destructive action. Make
sure to take backups.

If you want to push your local database to the servers.

```bash
fab push-staging-data
fab push-production-data
```

Or if you want to push your local media files.

```bash
fab push-staging-media
fab push-production-media
```

## Scheduled tasks

When you set up a server you should make sure the following scheduled tasks are set.


* `django-admin publish_scheduled_pages` - every 10 minutes or more often. This is necessary to make publishing scheduled pages work.
* `django-admin clearsessions` - once a day (not necessary, but useful).
* `django-admin update_index` - once a day  (not necessary, but useful to make sure search index stays intact).
