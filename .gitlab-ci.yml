# This is a sample .gitlab-ci.yml created by wagtail-kit.  You should review
# it for any necessary changes.


# Stages are groups that jobs can be groupped into.
# Jobs within each stage run in parallel and if one of them fails, the next
# stage won't be run.
# This will set up the following:
#
# - Build stage: build of static assets.
# - Test stage: code style, migration, basic configuration checks and unit
#   tests.
# - Deploy stage: deploy to Heroku or Dokku.
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy


# Global variables accessible to the all jobs.
variables:
  # What SSH user and host to use for connecting to Dokku.
  # We host dev server and staging on the same instance so that's why it's set
  # as global for all the cases.
